# Backend_Development_Notes

Backend Development is also known as server-side development. It is everything that the users don’t see and contains behind-the-scenes activities that occur when performing any action on a website. It focuses primarily on databases, backend logic, APIs, and Servers.

Backend Developer Skills
To become a backend developer, you should have good knowledge about these topics:

Backend Programming Languages
Databases
Server
APIs


Knowledge of APIs



What is an API
The entire internet works via the medium of APIs. API stands for Application Programming Interface and API is a medium through which two computer software can talk to each other.

API is a set of rules and definitions that allow different clients, software, or services to communicate with each other over the internet. When two systems communicate, the server is the one that provides the API, and the client is the one who consumes it.

APIs take a request from the client or user and send it to the server, which then sends back a response based on the request.

This communication is done through HTTP methods such as:

GET: used to retrieve a resource.
DELETE: used to delete a resource.
PUT: used to replace an existing resource.
POST: used to create a new resource.
Backend developers should have extensive knowledge about APIs since they are medium which enables data transfer. APIs generally act as a mediator between the backend and the databases enabling the developers to fetch the user data. Backend developers create APIs using various languages and frameworks including Python, NodeJS, etc. These APIs then can be consumed by frontend developers to collect the data, and show it on the frontend side of the website, and enhance the User Experience.

The two most recognized positions for API information are JSON, which represents JavaScript Object Notation, and XML, which represents eXtensible Markup Language.


Some other backend development skills include –

Ability to manage a hosting environment along with database administration.
Knowledge of scaling applications to handle the load changes that is a large amount of data traffic.
Knowledge of accessibility and security compliances.
Knowledge of version control such as Git and GitHub.
They should be good communicators so that they can communicate ideas and add value to their teams.
In-depth knowledge of deploying or hosting.
Knowledge of AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud Platform is a plus. These all are cloud-hosting markets. Heroku is a container-based cloud platform service (PaaS) and AWS is a cloud platform that provides IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS, and SaaS (Software as a Service).
